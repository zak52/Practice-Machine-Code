# Practicing-Machine-Code
Coding Projects from CS200:

These are different coding projects that were done during my CS200 class.
CS 200 - Introduction To Computer Organization:

Binary representation of information in digital computers. An introduction 
to digital logic design, computer architectures, microprocessor architectures 
and assembly language programming.

We practice different coding algorithms using machine code and C.
These are very basic level coding algorithms to properly learn the different
coding languages displayed in this class.
